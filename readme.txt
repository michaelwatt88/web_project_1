Title: Yandex Practicum Web-Project-1
Author: Michael Watt

Description: 
Web-Project-1 is a hands on exercise demonstrating recently learned skills in HTML and CSS. 
The two languages used are HTML and CSS.

Future Plans:
I plan to add user functionality utilizing JavaScript and forms in order to allow users 
to register and/or find out more about the Practicum program.
